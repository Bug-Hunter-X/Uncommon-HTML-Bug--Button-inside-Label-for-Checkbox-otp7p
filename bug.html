<p>This is a demonstration of an uncommon HTML bug related to nested elements and unexpected behavior in certain browsers.  The issue arises when using a `<button>` element inside a `<label>` element for a checkbox or radio button, but the `<button>` doesn't directly interact with the form element.</p><p>Example:</p><code><label for="myCheckbox">Select this checkbox:<button>Click me</button><input type="checkbox" id="myCheckbox"></label></code><p>The problem: Clicking the button might not toggle the checkbox as expected in all browsers, and some might even exhibit unexpected behavior, like submit actions or other strange side effects.</p>
